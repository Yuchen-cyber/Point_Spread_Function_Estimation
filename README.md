# Point_Spread_Function_Estimation
This repository contains two point spread fuctions(psf) using convolutional neural networks.
1. The first psf is gaussian psf used to deblur the galaxy images.
2. The second psf is Photoacoustic Computed Tomography psf (PACT psf) used to deconstruct the medical images.

The related papers and the presnetation power point will be included under the 'resources' folder. If you are interested, you can check them!
