# Point_Spread_Function_Estimation
This repository contains two point spread fuctions(psf) estimation using convolutional neural networks.
1. The first psf is gaussian psf used to deblur the galaxy images.
2. The second psf is Photoacoustic Computed Tomography psf (PACT psf) used to reconstruct the medical images.

The code for generating the psf ground truth images are modified from https://github.com/Lukeli0425/LR-PSF.

The related papers and the presnetation power point will be included under the 'resources' folder. If you are interested, you can check them!
